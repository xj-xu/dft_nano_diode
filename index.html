     <p>Abstract: Time-dependent density functional theory is utilized to si    mulate an asymmetrical jellium model, representing a nano-scale vacuum-tub    e diode comprised of bulk lithium. A sharp tip on one end of the jellium m    odel allows for enhanced field emission upon interaction with an external     laser field, leading to a preferential net current direction. This is veri    fied by comparing the rate of electron transfer between the effective anod    e and cathode tips for both the diode jellium model and a symmetric cylind    er jellium shape for various laser phase parameters. This rate of transfer     is shown to significantly increase with smaller separation distances. Wit    h stronger laser intensities, this rate similarly increases but levels off     as local near-field enhancements become negligible.</p>
