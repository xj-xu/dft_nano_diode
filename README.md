The modern age of electronics was marked by the development of the integrated circuit whose foundation was the semiconductor-based transistor. This technology allowed for low power consumption, reliability, and intuitive circuit design, thereby outpacing and replacing the earlier relied upon vacuum-tube-based implements. Such semiconductor-based devices have been the backdrop of the advancing field of electronics for many years; however, as the push for ultrafast operating speeds approaches the petahertz range,1 the limited electron transport velocity of semiconductor transistors presents a formidable obstacle. Recent interest in electron photo-emission from metal nanotips, motivated by improved ultrafast laser-guidance of electrons, has inspired research pointing back in the direction of vacuum transport as a path towards achieving such higher speeds, with some prototype transistor devices being fabricated in the last few years.

In this project, time-dependent density functional theory is utilized to simulate an asymmetrical jellium model, representing a nano-scale vacuum-tube diode comprised of bulk lithium. A sharp tip on one end of the jellium model allows for enhanced field emission upon interaction with an external laser field, leading to a preferential net current direction. This is verified by comparing the rate of electron transfer between the effective anode and cathode tips for both the diode jellium model and a symmetric cylinder jellium shape for various laser phase parameters. This rate of transfer is shown to significantly increase with smaller separation distances. With stronger laser intensities, this rate similarly increases but levels off as local near-field enhancements become negligible.
